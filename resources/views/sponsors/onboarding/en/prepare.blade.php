# Prepare For Your Engagement

Publishing a document on Madison is simple, but truly impactful engagement with
the public takes thoughtfulness and empathy from you.

## What is your *outreach* plan?

- **Who should know** that you are seeking feedback on this document and how do you plan to tell them? *We suggest*:
  - Journalists and the press
  - Civic and community groups
  - Academic institutions
  - Local meetups
  - Internal email lists
- Which **traditional or social media platforms** can you use to invite constituents to use share feedback? *We suggest*:
  - Including the web address of the document in your outreach so that others can easily share it.
  - Writing a few example tweets (less than 140 characters) to help people share.
- **Are there other** government officials or community partners with a different
audience that can help promote engagement? *We suggest*:
  - People or organizations that care about this topic but are different in other ways like politics, industry, or geography.

## Have you thought about *timing*?

- **When** should we publish the document? *We suggest*:
  - Start when there is already energy around your topic.
  - Align your engagement with other types of engagement, such as public hearing or town hall events.
- **How long** should the engagement period last? Put differently, how long do you want to accept comments on the document? *We suggest*:
  - Two weeks is often long enough to get good results and short enough to maintain momentum.

## Have you considered how this *looks*?

- **Who** exactly is asking the public for their opinion? This is communicated on your document by saying "Shared for feedback by [sponsor name]". *We suggest*:
  - Make the sponsor the person or organization that would be most appropriate and influential. For example, this could be a person like the Mayor or Chief Data Officer, or an organization like a city, a department, or nonprofit.
  - Make sure that you have buy-in from everyone involved. For example, don't attribute the engagement without getting the proper sign-offs.
