# Actively Participate

Publishing the document is just the beginning. Once it's published, you as a
sponsor are responsible for creating and curating conversation. *We suggest*:
- Who is **monitoring the activity**? Make sure that someone is clearly identified and that person will receive notifications (see notification settings).
- **Reply to comments**. When appropriate, reply to comments. Constituents love knowing that you are really involved. Note that comments are from your account, not the sponsor account.
- **Moderate comments**. Rarely someone will leave an inappropriate comment. To hide it, you (or any user) can flag it. Once flagged, you can hide any flagged comment using the administration interface.
- **Delegate**. Multiple users can belong to a sponsor, so don't be afraid to delegate tasks.
- **Close the discussion.** When the engagement period is over, close the discussion in the administration interface.
