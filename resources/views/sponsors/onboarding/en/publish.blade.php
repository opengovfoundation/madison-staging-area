# Publish Your Document

- After mapping out a successful engagement strategy and the sponsor has been
approved, you can **draft your document** in Madison. *Here's a quick start guide*:
  - Head to your 'Sponsors' page by selecting it from the drop-down menu under your name
  - Click 'New Document'
  - Copy & Paste the plain text of your document
  - Click 'Save' (Note: don't change Publish State until you're ready for this document to be public.)

- This will save your bare-bones document, but there's much more to do to make your engagement successful. *We suggest*:
  - **Write a compelling introduction.** This is the first thing people will read. The introduction should help them understand: 1) Who are you are and why you care about their opinion? 2) Why should they participate? Will it have any impact? 3) What are you going to do with their feedback?
  - **Use headings.** Headings make the document much easier to scan, especially if the document is long. Documents with headings also display an outline to help people navigate. You can add headings with the header buttons (H1, H2, and H3) in the toolbar.
  - **Avoid (or define) jargon.** Technical terms can be intimidating, so avoid them whenever possible. In the cases where it's unavoidable, define them by linking to a definition.
  - **Advanced formatting.** Madison uses Markdown to format documents. This [Markdown
guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is helpful if you need to do any advanced formatting.
